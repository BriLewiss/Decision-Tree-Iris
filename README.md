# Decision-Tree-Iris
This repository contains an implementation of a Decision Tree classifier from scratch using Python to classify the Iris dataset. The decision tree algorithm is implemented without using high-level machine learning libraries, providing a deeper understanding of how decision trees work.

The tree is built recursively, splitting the dataset at each node based on the best feature and threshold to maximize information gain. The implementation can calculate information gain using either entropy or Gini index. 

## Usage
1. Clone the repository

2. Install the required libraries.

pip install numpy scikit-learn

3. Run the code

python3 decision_tree.py
